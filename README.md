## Installation

### Add it to yours Sublim Text Packages

 * Download the zip
 * Unzip and rename it like you want
 * Copy the folder into the Package directory. You can find it in Sublim Text using `Preferences -> Browse Packages`

### Activate it

You have to modify your preferences files. To do it, use `Preferences -> Settings - User` in the menu. Then activate it by adding or modifying your settings like this :

```
{
  "theme": "tm.itg.flat.dark.sublime-theme"
}
```

I recommend to use the default color scheme of Sublim Text, Monokai, with it (`Preferences -> Color Scheme -> Color Scheme - Default -> Monokai`).
